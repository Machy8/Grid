# Contributing and editing

If you want to edit the css you will need to install.

- gulp
- gulp-autoprefixer
- gulp-clean-css (if you want to minify the output css)
- gulp-rename (if you want to minify the output css)
- gulp-sass
- gulp-sourcemaps
- backstopjs (if would want to send pull request)
- and is good to have support of the sass syntax in your editor

To run the preprocessor, open console, go into the directory with the *grid-css-framework* repository and run "gulp" task. This will run the gulp watch task and the first compilation.
