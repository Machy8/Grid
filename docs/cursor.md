# Cursor

Sometime is useful to have class with which you can change the cursor icon. For example on **a** element with *role=button* you maybe would want to have pointer icon.

- **Auto:** cursor-auto
- **Default:** cursor-default
- **Pointer:** cursor-pointer
- **Wait:** cursor-wait
- **Help:** cursor-help

## Example
````Html
<a role=button class="cursor-pointer">Some link</a>
````
